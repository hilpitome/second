<h1 align="center">Things that I do not like</h1>
<h2 align="center">A Rugby Sevens match between Kenya and Fiji.</h2>
<p>The Kenyan Sevens rugby team has been doing relatively well over the years. We have beaten all the big teams. We have beaten NewZealand, South Africa, England (do not remind me how we threw away a few vital seconds against this team in a main cup finals in Wellington and lost the coveted price!) Wales and Australia However, I do not really know whether we have beaten Fiji in any of the circuits ever since we started shining on the big stage. In fact the most painful of experience was in a game where Fiji beat us with around fifty points to five and yet they played with one man less in the second half due to a red card. I even remember now that I do not like watching the HSNBC rugby series this days as a result of this. 
I will get back to being the fun I used to be if only we lift the main cup once. After that I will not care who beats us. Oh! And if we beat Fiji in the process then it will be an added bonus.</p>
<h2 align="center">Horror movies.</h2>
<p>I despise horror movies completely. Do not get me wrong. Monsters and blood do not scare me at all. If anything I see more blood in serial killer themed films than in the horror genre. Serial killers make their victims suffer more I believe. Horror movies just make me sick because they are very predictable. For one, why the hell would you go about exploring the shadows and yet you know that there is some creature out there ready to pounce on you?
This also brings me to another similar type of movie. The zombie movies. I just do not understand them. What is so entertaining about sitting in front of a screen for over 90 minutes watching a bunch of guys shoot and hack mindless creatures who can not move properly?</p>
