<h1>One Resolution</h1>
<p>Last year i remember making a resolution to post something at least every week. Well, that did not pan out so well, did it? I could make excuses and blame it on time, work, something... but we know that would  be a total lie. I am not as busy as I would want you to believe although the idea of being busy is rather satisfying.
So this year I make just one resolution, No Excuses.

Sounds easy, doesn't it? Well for someone like me, it really isn't. I like to have options. I want to look at a list of things and say, 'I like this one better than that one'. When it doesn't work out as planned I always have a reason why. This may be the definition of 'making excuses' to many people. I also happen to be a little bit lazy... Just sometimes.

2015 is not the year for that. This year, I will change my perspective on life. I will look at things differently, do the opposite of what I wouldn't normally  do... Most importantly, MAKE NO EXCUSES.
That is my one resolution.

Happy New Year.</p>
