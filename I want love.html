<h1>I want Love</h1>
<p>I want love...

I want to wake up at 3 am in the morning just to make sure I am alive because I cant wait to see your face.
I want to look into your eyes and see the sun set on a rainy day, To see 9 rainbows in the dark sky and a full moon on cloudy night.

I want love...

I want to breathe in the vibrations in your voice and fill my lungs with your smile until it suffocates me,
I want to touch your lips with my fingers and feel a surge through my body
...that would ground my feet to spot where i stand.
I want to smell your skin,
Your sweaty body on mine in the rain and we wouldn't know the difference, 
Nigga, i want love!</p>
