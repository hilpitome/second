<h1>Silence is Golden, Speech is Silver... I like Silver.</h1>
<p>Despite what many think, being a girl in your twenties is really hard. These are your glory years when you are supposed to discover yourself, live a little, make lifetime friends, find your forever after, become an alcoholic and quit in time.
You have just 12 years, 18 to 30, to figure out what kind of midlife crisis you want to have. That is a lot of pressure for one person. At 23 I feel like I have not exactly used those 6 years correctly. Fine I have done some of those things, well mostly in fractions I mean I am barely half way through discovering myself. I could blame it all on school but that would be a straight up lie. I am not exactly the perfect student. I will graduate but not the Einstein type of graduate.
